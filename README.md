# Quatum Bioflux nanogizmo transatron üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CodCell


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Gayathri Jyothi Prakash - Sahrdaya College Of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Abhijith M - Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
Quantum Bioflux is the result of the collab between Computer Science and Biotechnology,
how with the help of Technology the microbe grwos with the help of pH and temperature conditions

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The Critical Deficiency in Hyperdimensional Microbial Resonance Misalignment and Its Impact on Nonexistent Quantum Bioflux Dynamics. 
Yes, a major issue faced by the This misalignment, undetected by conventional (and imaginary) quantum spectrometers, leads to a cascade of pseudo-entropic disturbance

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Quantum Bioflux Nanogizmo Transatron solves the nonexistent crisis of hyperdimensional microbial resonance misalignment with
useless features like dancing microbes, holographic trails, shape-shifting, cloning, robotic voiceovers, and absurd JSON exports.

Geeky Lines
The microbe shouting out unecessary quotings during the touch by the user

Blackout 
on touching the pH scale the screen blackouts for a while
